# Running the application

Clone my repository to your local machine by opening command prompt, navigate to the folder you wish to clone it in and enter:

	git clone https://github.com/Mrlarkin24/Emerging-Technologies.git
	
Running the Jupyter notebooks:

Open the cloned folder in command prompt and enter the following
	jupyter notebook

Running the python script:

Open the cloned folder in command prompt and enter the following
	python digitrec.py
or
	py digitrec.py
	
Note: I had trouble with errors to do with keras and sklearn installation, I was able to fix the keras error but unfortunately ran out of time before being able to fix the sklearn error.
As a result of this I was unable to run the code.
